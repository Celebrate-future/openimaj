# Open Intelligent Multimedia Analysis for Java (OpenIMAJ)

OpenIMAJ is an award-winning collection of libraries and tools for multimedia (images, text, video, audio, etc.) content analysis and content generation. OpenIMAJ is very broad and contains everything from state-of-the-art computer vision (e.g., SIFT descriptors, salient region detection, face detection, etc.) and advanced data clustering, through to software that performs analysis on the content, layout, and structure of web pages.

## How to use OpenIMAJ

## Compiling OpenIMAJ from source

Instructions for source compilation can be found here: https://github.com/openimaj/openimaj/wiki/Compiling-OpenIMAJ-from-Source
Please note that you probably don't want to do this unless you intend on adding new features or making changes to the source code; pre-compiled JARs of release versions are available from Maven Central, and regular snapshots (built automatically when code is pushed to the GitHub repository) are available here: http://snapshots.openimaj.org
